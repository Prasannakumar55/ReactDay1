1 . What is the Difference between React and React native ?
            Which one is library or framework?

            React is a javascript library and the React native is a
            javascript framework both are developed by the facebook.
            React is a single page application and it is used to build
            web-applications and the React native is a popular javascript mobile 
            app framework. we can build the both Andriod and ios mobile apps.

        2 . What is the package name you are using for routing ?

            React Router is a standard library for routing in React.
            install the React-router-dom modules for using in project
            React Router Dom is used to build single-page applications.
            applications that have many pages but the page is never refreshed 
            this is the major advantage of react-routers

        3 . Routing Implementation ?

            create the individual components like Home, Student, Contact and each component 
            import a link tag from the react-router-dom to Navbar
                {Home}
                {Students}
                {Contact}
           
            Add the all links to the all components
                <Link to='Home'> Home </Link>
                <Link to='Students'> Students </Link>
                <Link to='Contact'> Contact </Link>
            In app.js import the all components and add the Navbar add after the BrowserRouter because it will show in the top of the webpage      
            <BrowserRouter>
              <Navbar/>
                <Routes>
                        <Route path='/Home' element={< Home />} />
                        <Route path='/Students' element={< Students />} />
                        <Route path='/Contact' element={< Contact />} />
                    </Route>
                </Routes>
            <BrowserRouter>

        finally path is refreshed to the component of the element without refreshing 

        4 . How do you pass data from parent to child ?

        Following are the steps to pass data from child component to parent component
        In the parent component, create a callback function. This callback s
        function will return the data from the child component.
        Pass the callback function to the child as a props from the parent component.
        The child component calls the parent callback function using props 
        and passes the data to the parent component.
        import the chile

        5 . What is lazy loading in React ?

            Lazy loading is the process that delaying load or initialization 
            of data or objects until they're actually needed to 
            improve performance and save the memory.

            Example : 

            const Home = React.lazy(() => import("./Home"));

        6 . Difference between Stateful and stateless Component

            Stateful :

            In React if we use a state in a perticular component that is called 
            the Stateful like state, setstate etc

            stateless :

            In React if we dosen't use any state in a perticular component 
            that is called the stateless like props etc

        7 . How do you switch one component to another, Conditional Rendering

            react-routers are the one to switch the one component to another.
            Conditional rendering in React works the same way conditions work in JavaScript. 
            Use JavaScript operators like if or the conditional operator to create elements 
            representing the current state, and let React update the UI to match them.
            The if else statemebt and ternary operators are the  one for using  Conditional rendering
